# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a proof-of-concept campsite sharing RESTful application. It runs on node.js with the express framework and uses various other libraries to add better design and user experience. I'm using MongoDB (hosted on mlab.com) for my database. View the live website on Heroku.

NOTE: currently offline because people have been absuing it, let me know if you'd like to take a look at the live demo on Heroku.
